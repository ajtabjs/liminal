    <p> i've got things to do today, but i might just take it slow.
        <br><br>
talking to friends seemed nice, and i found something out about one of my trusted ones.
        <br><br>
i'm supporting them though, i've known them for a long time and to me it doesnt really matter as much.<br><br>
i've trusted them for a while, so i guess it's time for them to trust me as well. <br><br>
