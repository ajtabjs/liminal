    <p> i'm running out of song ideas again for the site, so here's some eminem.
        <br><br>
things have been becoming bland since there's not that much routine anymore.
        <br><br>
i've also been going crazy thinking about someone, im confused on whether they care about me, or whether it's something else.<br><br>
either way i'll figure it out eventually.<br><br>
