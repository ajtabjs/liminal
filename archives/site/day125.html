    <p> i have the school day off,
        <br><br>
cause teachers are preparing for the new term.
        <br><br>
my development team got into some heated debates last night about planning,<br><br>
but it's just life that gets the best of us with our emotions.<br><br>
we'll all figure it out eventually.<br><br>
anyways, i have a busy day today, <br><br>
so i'm trying to make the most of it.<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
