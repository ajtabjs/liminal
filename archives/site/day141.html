    <p>its wednesday now.
        <br><br>
yesterday i had that feeling that something seemed off again,
        <br><br>
i tried talking to someone and they didn't help much this time.<br><br>
how can something seem unrealistic when its something you haven't bothered to try yet?<br><br>
thanks. <br><br>
