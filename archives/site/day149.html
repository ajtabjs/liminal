    <p> days will be days, and there's nothing much we can do about it.
        <br><br>
all we have to do is look up, and hope that better days come.
        <br><br>
it might be my fault, but at least i learned from my mistakes.<br><br>
things are slowly getting done, <br><br>
so i think i'll be okay. <br><br>
thanks. <br><br>
