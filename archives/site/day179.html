    <p> the weekend now, yipeee!
        <br><br>
things have been doing decent i suppose,
        <br><br>
with new innovations being along the wait.<br><br>
i can't wait for what will happen, <br><br>
but if it's like anything else,<br><br>
it'll mean i have to stay patient until the right time comes. <br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
