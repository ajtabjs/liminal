    <p>have a random image from my life again. <br> <br>
       yesterday felt like an eh day.  <br>
       <br> i gave up trying to rice a linux instance cause it felt too hard.
       <br><br>
       but i'll keep trying at it because its a small part of a big goal i have.
       <br><br>
       i won't stop until it's done, no matter how long it takes.
