    <p> it's tuesday.
        <br><br>
i don't know which one's better, 
        <br><br>
physical sleep or mental sleep?<br><br>
it's one those questions that sparks up a lot of debate.<br><br>
some would say mental health is more important than some grade, <br><br>
while others say that grades are what makes the future workers.<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
