    <p>it's monday.
        <br><br>
strange that i have to repeat a song again, but i hope it's for the right reasons.
        <br><br>
yesterday i was thinking back and wondering why the world is so mean to everyone.<br><br>
everyone argues all the time, politicians, citizens, and even company owners.<br><br>
i don't like it,<br><br>
and i want a chance to express myself for once.<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
