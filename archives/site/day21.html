    <p>well sometimes, you just have to talk to people so they can understand you properly. <br> <br>
       i did that yesterday and the person was okay with things. <br>
       <br> at least that's one thing that i don't have to keep from them anymore.
       <br><br>
       regardless of that, i'm still trying to pursue my goals.
       <br><br>
       yesterday. i learned how to make a video format that i like and i might be using it in the future.
       <br><br> either way, i hope that the time spent to myself will be worth it.<br><br>
thanks.
