    <p>saturday.
        <br><br>
i'm a bit tired, but i'll try to get whatever i can done.<br><br>
might as well put in some work into this project,<br><br>
cause i've already gotten so far to have this all crashing down.<br><br>
can't leave off on a bad note, so i'll do what i can to get this going.<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
