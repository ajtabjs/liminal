    <p>still keeping this image here for a reason lol
        <br><br>
        i actually found fucking good friends, and i thank them for that.
        <br>
        <br>
        they both said i'm weird but i'm thinking it's in a good way.<br><br>
        my old friend group kept being toxic to people and shit, <br><br>
        it wasn't the greatest thing, but i dealt with it.
        <br><br> i'm just grateful for them, and they might not feel like it,<br><br> 
        but they've helped me through a lot of shit.
        <br><br> thanks, you know who you are. :)
