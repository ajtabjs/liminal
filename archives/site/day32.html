    <p>yipeee, it's the month aniversary of this site
        <br><br>
        since well, there wasnt a november 31st
        <br>
        <br>
        and well there's been an extra day somehow in the site, <br><br>
        i dont know what's up with it, nor do i really care. <br><br>
        what matters is that i've survived this whole time
        <br><br> my break is slowly ending, and it's both good and bad.<br><br> 
        right now, i'll just be chilling though.
        <br><br> but hey, maybe it'll be even better tomorrow :)
