    <p>well, im back in school now from thanksgiving break
        <br><br>
        i just have to deal with things i guess
        <br>
        <br>
        i spent the time on my break wisely though <br><br>
        so maybe it was worth it after all <br><br>
       anyways, i might try to reconnect with some friends,
        <br><br> let's hope they missed me as much as i missed them.<br><br>
