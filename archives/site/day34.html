    <p>today i woke up early to make breakfast for my family (again)
        <br><br>
        i noticed the day before that everyone seemed mad or tired
        <br>
        <br>
        so i took the time out of my day to wake up early and do something nice for them<br><br>
        my mom got mad at me because i was up so early <br><br>
       so she decided to help me since she couldn't sleep.
        <br><br> but hey, at least of my family will hopefully have a better day because of the small thing i did.<br><br> 
        i'm tired, but it's fucking worth it. <br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
