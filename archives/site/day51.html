    <p> time feels like it's moving too fast.
        <br><br>
    routine feels that way, yet i never get to try anything new.
        <br>
        <br>
       everyone else is too busy with their own lives to ever stop and live in the present.<br><br>
        we all have to take some time to ourselves, <br><br>
        but i don't think they understand.<br><br>
        i already got a bit mad with my sister trying to take my friends away from me,<br><br>
        so why should i care? <br><br>
