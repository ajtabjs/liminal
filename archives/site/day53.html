well i tried straying the topic from the one that mattered the most.

i got away with it for a bit, but i dont know how long it's going to last.

i just don't want any arguments like that anymore.

    <p> well i was right, the day before break was epic.
        <br><br>
i had so much fun with my friends, and they'll miss me very much over break.
        <br>
        <br>
       i was given cookies from one of them and the picture isnt backed up into my onedrive yet so i can't show it right now.<br><br>
        but it was fun either way. <br><br>
       i got into some arguments with my parents but i've learned from things.<br><br>
        i'll be fine as long as i still care for my friends and family.<br><br>
        one thing is for sure, i'll miss my friends a lot over break. <br><br>
        love ya E + R :3 <br><br>
