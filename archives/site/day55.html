    <p> still havent done my work in a while, but my music video is coming up nice.
        <br><br>
oh well, i guess i have priorites set first.
        <br>
        <br>
      as time goes on, i guess we all have to set things straight.<br><br>
        no matter what happens, i promised myself that i'd finish things. <br><br>
       my friends are doing okay i guess, one of them went to a bruno mars concert.<br><br>
       my family still has arguments and debates from time to time on topic that i dont like, <br><br>
        but who am i to care? <br><br>
