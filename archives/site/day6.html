    <p> that weird feeling is still here for some reason.<br> <br>
        i just haven't been able to focus on things.
        <br>
        maybe it's for a reason though, but im not sure.
        <br> progress on fixing that white box have been slow since i still need to get the cables,<br>
        but it'll be alright for the meantime i guess.
