    <p> the spotify downloader i use for the music is down right now so no song today.<br> <br>
        the image i was also going to use is on my phone so i cant put that on the site until later.
        <br><br>
        besides that, we all have to focus on our goals no matter what.
        <br> i've let people get in the way of a bunch of things and thats affecting me.<br>
        but i'll be alright once i choose to stop caring.
