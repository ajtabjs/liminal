    <p> i guess sometimes even in the midst of everything,
        <br><br>
people still find a way to blame it on you.
        <br><br>
they laughed at me last night, said my "productivity" that i did over break was nothing.<br><br>
       i cried myself to sleep last night, because that showed they didn't care for what i wanted to do with things. <br><br>
        alright then, well if they don't want to care for me, then why should i care for them?<br><br>
