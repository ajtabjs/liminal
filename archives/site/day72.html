    <p> well, i guess even sometimes our expectations get surprised and surpassed.

things ended up being alright after all.
        <br><br>
i'm hoping today i'll get some things done,<br><br>
     but it's never always a guaruntee sometimes. <br><br>
        if i get things done, then that's fine.<br><br>
        if i don't, well at least i had fun trying. <br><br>
