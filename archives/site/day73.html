even when you get reminded of crazy things you did in the past, it's easier to let go and deal with it than argue with that person.

    <p> yesterday was a slow yet crazy day.
        <br><br>
right in the morning i stumbled across a person i haven't talked to in a while, 
        <br><br>
mainly because they hate me or something.<br><br>
     i'm not sure but it was a bit shocking to say the least. <br><br>
        i got reminded of stupid things i did in the past, <br><br>
        and i just chose to accept it and move on. <br><br>
        i also had some small accomplishments as well, <br><br>
        so that's nice. <br><br>
        i just want to spend time right now with people, it's nice to see them smile.<br><br>
        sometimes you have good connections with them and geniunely enjoy their presence.<br><br>
        as for me, well it's nice to have people i can actually talk to.<br><br>
