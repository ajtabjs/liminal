    <p> well, i guess to some people, things are a waste of time.
        <br><br>
it's alright what they think.
        <br><br>
but i guess at least for me, it doesn't matter if i didnt finish or got the chance to do it.<br><br>
at least i tried. <br><br>
        you know, some people waste money for me, when most of the time i didn't want the thing they bought. <br><br>
        but hey, if they want to do that, they can.<br><br>
        it's up to me to find out what to actually do with it. <br><br>
        but hey, i can't please everyone. <br><br>
        and that's okay.<br><br>
