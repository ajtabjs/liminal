    <p> the weekend is over, and i'm back in school now.
        <br><br>
my business cards ended up great, and i ordered another batch.
        <br><br>
yesterday was pretty cool, was talking to a friend and we discussed some deep stuff.<br><br>
the world seems pretty dystopian nowadays and no one can be themselves anymore. <br><br>
        it felt nice talking to someone like that, i havent been able to sit down and play games like that in a while. <br><br>
hopefully maybe sometime they'll be up for it again.<br><br>
        or maybe i can have some other friends join in as well. <br><br>
        either way, i know it's going to be so much fun. <br><br>
        thanks landon.<br><br>
