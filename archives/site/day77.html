    <p> well even sometimes, things don't end up your way.
        <br><br>
and that's okay.
        <br><br>
one of my friends responded to me after a couple of days of not texting back,<br><br>
and it was nice to talk to him for a bit. <br><br>
     i feel like this year is the year for me to try to be open about things, <br><br>
 even if it seems like half the world hates me.<br><br>
        who cares? at least i'm having fun. <br><br>
        it's worth it to get out of your comfort zone for a while. :D <br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
