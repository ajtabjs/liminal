    <p> the image i wanted to put for today isn't on here yet, so here's a different one from a couple of days ago.
        <br><br>
things have been slow and steady so far,
        <br><br>
and spending time with friends has been alright.<br><br>
i might just try to take things slow for a bit, <br><br>
     so if i seem off, you know why. <br><br>
i've been talking with some friends and they recommend that i try to do things that'll help me.<br><br>
        either way, i'm just having fun with myself. <br><br>
        slow things that i do everyday are starting to be worth it. <br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
