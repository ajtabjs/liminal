you know, maybe we just actually need a time to relax.
        <br><br>
decompress from all of our problems, one way or another.<br><br>
i was talking with a friend yesterday and he seemed to agree with my plans for the future. <br><br>
     i gotta stop trying to control everything. <br><br>
it's hurting me more than it's helping.<br><br>
        either way, i gotta change something. <br><br>
        maybe today will be my last day of a crazy routine. <br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
