    <p> things never make sense sometimes.
        <br><br>
all these arguments all in one day, i still dont feel like i have enough energy.
        <br><br>
routine is hectic now, with more extra days being added.<br><br>
it's tiring for me, but they dont seem to care.<br><br>
     the least i can do is try. <br><br>
i just need some time to get my thoughts together.<br><br>
my few friends who care are honestly the people helping.<br><br>
thank you, cause i wouldn't be anywhere without them.<br><br>
