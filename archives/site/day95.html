    <p> today was a bit slow and quick.
        <br><br>
i had some mood swings, but i guess it ended up alright.
        <br><br>
the friends who i used to hang out with, don't stay with me anymore because of some rumor that spread. <br><br>
i don't really care though, i got my own life to worry about.<br><br>
     but i guess it's alright.<br><br>
they'll both be shocked when they figure out my secret either way, so why not start the improvement while i'm alone?<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
