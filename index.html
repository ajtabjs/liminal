    <p>yesterday i spent 3 hours making an edit that lasted about 15 seconds or so
        <br><br>
        it was fucking worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        while i was in the process of making it, i was looking through old photos to find material i could use for the video<br><br>
        i found one of the first pictures that formed the whole friendship i have with them. <br><br>
       obviously i'm not going to show it here, but it meant a lot to me.
        <br><br> all that chaos, fun, and enjoyment i have with them, means a lot to me, and i don't know where i'd be now without them.<br><br> 
        they helped me, supported me, and gave me new music to listen to, some of which i still have on my spotify playlists today. <br><br>
        thanks, you know who you are :D<br><br>
