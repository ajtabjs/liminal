    <p>i spent last night thinking of some friends.
        <br><br>
some people that either drifted away because of life, 
        <br><br>
people who left me because of what i told them,<br><br>
or just some who didn't care at all.<br><br>
either way, i still forgive most of them. <br><br>
i just don't know whether they'll forgive me. <br><br>
either way, it'll be alright, right?<br><br>
thanks. <br><br>
