    <p> already trying to do some work and i feel overwhelmed with how much i don't understand it.
        <br><br>
i've tried getting help with it,
        <br><br>
but people are just as fed up as i am about it. <br><br>
        i don't know what to do, and i only have 3 days left to finish it before i go back to school. <br><br>
        this just seems too complicated. <br><br>
