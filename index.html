    <p> finally have the time to relax now, yesterday was very great.
        <br><br>
finally achieved straight A's in school, and i got to take a break from everything.
        <br><br>
it was nice working on things that i liked, <br><br>
and i hope today i can work on another video that'll make me happy. <br><br>
     it's great to feel like this, and i know it'll be worth it more once i complete my other goals as well. <br><br>
i finished reading a book yesterday, and i saw a good quote from it.<br><br>
"So, be present and attentive to right now – it’s the only place that’s real."<br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
