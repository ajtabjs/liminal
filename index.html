    <p> well, i guess that even when you're in arguments, 
        <br><br>
       somehow your point get proven back to you.
        <br>

        that people will always try to bring you down, or sabotage your new and exciting ideas.<br><br>
        but who fucking cares?<br><br>
        ignore them, and things will be fine as long as you believe in yourself.<br><br>
