this new routine is a bit more relaxing, more lenient, but i still have to put the same amount of effort in it though, regardless of how i feel at that moment.

    <p> yesterday was fine.
        <br><br>
i just didn't do much with my time.
        <br><br>
i had the time to myself since i finished quick with things, but i didnt spend it right.<br><br>
but at least i got some extra time, that's what matters. <br><br>
     what i do with my time though, is up to me. <br><br>
i've been told by my friend that "once you start working, you never stop", which is depressingly true.<br><br>
        maybe i should just enjoy myself and not worry about a job for now.<br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
