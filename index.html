    <p> things are confusing sometimes.
        <br><br>
but we just have to deal how to deal with it.
        <br><br>
things are slowly getting on the right track,<br><br>
but it'll take time to improve.<br><br>
     with more time being spent on things i like, <br><br>
i'm getting a better time to get my thoughts together.<br><br>
some of my friends aren't staying with me as much after class, but everyone has life sometimes.<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
