    <p> it's monday again and it's my friend's birthday!
        <br><br>
       happy birthday to her, but things are slowly beginning to become routine again.
        <br>
        <br>
        time feels fast because of that, but i'll try to do something new today.<br><br>
        i also have started to run out of songs so today's is a bit depressing.<br><br>
        oh yeah and yesterday was a bit exciting too but we'll get into that another time :D<br><br>
