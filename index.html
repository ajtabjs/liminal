    <p> well, routine goes by quick, and that usually doesn't leave a lot of time to do other things.
        <br><br>
at least i got it over with though.
        <br><br>
i might start spending my time more wisely, but i'm not sure.<br><br>
maybe i have to do something challenging today, <br><br>
     something that'll make me happy, but yet i'm so scared to even try again. <br><br>
but maybe it's worth a chance.<br><br>
        after all, no one would have ever suceeded if they stayed in their comfort zone.<br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
