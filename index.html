    <p> i found the video i was going to put on the site, a day later.<br> <br>
       it made me think about the time's i've spent with friends and whether i enjoyed it or not.
        <br><br>
        i've had a lot of experiences where people havent cared about me, and that's alright.
        <br> it doesnt matter what other people think of me,<br>
        but what i think of myself.
