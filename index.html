    <p> well, it's monday again.
        <br><br>
my parents decided to add extra days of things onto the new schedule.
        <br><br>
i didn't want it, so i tried sharing my opinion about it. <br><br>
they didn't listen either way, so i guess i'm going through those days again.<br><br>
     if i do end up feeling burnt out, then that's on them i guess. <br><br>
i ended up not doing something important yesterday, and now i feel like i missed that oppurtunity now.<br><br>
maybe i could do it over the next weekend, but that seems a bit far away right now.<br><br>
either way, i hope i can have more great days spending time with my friends, they seem to care for me more.<br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
       -  1/27/25
