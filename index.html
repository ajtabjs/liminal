    <p> today felt off.
        <br><br>
there was something that needed to be done it seems,
        <br><br>
but i dont think it ever got done.<br><br>
i need to reprioritize things, but i hope i'll be able to soon.<br><br>
are things really looking up,<br><br>
or are they just starting to make bigger obstacles?<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
