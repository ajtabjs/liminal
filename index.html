    <p> i've spent almost a month now trying to relive old memories like how it used to be.<br> <br>
       i know i'll never get those memories back, no matter how much i try.
        <br><br>
        i have to move on with life.
        <br> <br> i never understood why there were people on that friends list that were online 7-8 years ago,<br>
        but people have moved on now, or they simply aren't there to be with us anymore.
