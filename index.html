    <p> yesterday was busy, that's all i can say.
        <br><br>
i don't know when im going to do my work but that's okay.
        <br>
        <br>
      as time goes on though, i'll have to do it one day or another.<br><br>
        oh well, i guess my other plans are out of order for now. <br><br>
       either way im sure i'll still be able to have fun.<br><br>
       it's just about finding the right moment. <br><br>
        even if i don't, i can always make it one. <br><br>
        thanks <br><br>
