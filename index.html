    <p> every single day it seems like they keep pushing me down.
        <br><br>
       every car ride back seems like a nightmare.
        <br>
        <br>
        they don't understand me and the only few people i can talk to are busy.<br><br>
        i have to figure things out by myself today.<br><br>
        i don't know when or how, but i'll get back up again.<br><br>
     thanks.<br><br>
