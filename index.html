    <p>today is the twentieth day of this site. <br> <br>
       it's crazy how such a simple thought could turn into something i update everyday. <br>
       <br> but hey, at least i can write down most of my thoughts in peace.
       <br><br>
       i'll still keep trying to get things done though.
       <br><br>
       i've been trying to get seperate from most of my friends since they aren't the best to hang out with.
       <br><br> i'm sure i'll find new ones eventually though, or maybe just go with the new ones i already have.<br><br>
thanks.
