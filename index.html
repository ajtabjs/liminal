    <p> yesterday felt weird.<br> <br>
        i didn't have energy, i felt bored at every single thing i did.
<br>
     it just didn't feel right.
        <br>
        <br>
       i was stressing over a single thing, then i stopped to wonder what i was doing it for. <br>
       one of my friends that i talked to, he felt the same way for some reason.
       <br>
       my family was just sitting on their asses scrolling through brainrot, or watching tv.
       <br> so i had to be the one doing things i needed the most for the next day.
       <br>whatever that feeling was however, it's pushing me to change things up a bit.
       <br> today i'm trying not to interact with my friends that much since i need time to myself.
       <br>
       <br>
       thanks.
