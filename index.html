<!-- 7:48 am, nov 03 2024, i was supposed to go on a hike by 8am.
 instead, i woke up early to have my parents get mad at me just because they wanted some sleep.
sometimes its not up to us to decide whether we want to do things or not.

    <p> sometimes i focus too much on things. <br>
        whether it's fixing something i love, or trying to get something back.
<br>
        i guess this time i won't fail myself the way my dad did when he threw it out.
        <br>
        <br>
       i have to make things happen and fix those three blinking lights once again. <br>
       it'll at least help me think back to when i didn't have to worry.
