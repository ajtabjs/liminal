    <p> i guess sometimes, you actually need insight on what the hell to do.
        <br><br>
    i never knew what the hell i was going to do with my life until i talked to someone yesterday.
        <br>
        <br>
       i'm still figuring it out but at least i'll try to do something that actually benefits me.<br><br>
        most of the time, it's all complicated with school and other issues.<br><br>
        but i guess that's all what we have to deal with sometimes.<br><br>
        and that's okay.<br><br>
        i'll just spend my time wisely and try to have a whole lot of fun. <br><br>
