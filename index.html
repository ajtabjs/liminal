    <p>it's wednesday.
        <br><br>
i don't know why this song comes up in my mind every now and then,
        <br><br>
but it must be something important. <br><br>
i had a great day with my friends yesterday,<br><br>
but it seems like now everything's becoming meh again. <br><br>
i wonder if this feeling will ever go away.<br><br>
thanks.<br><br>
