    <p> all it took was a hike to get my thoughts away from things,
        <br><br>
and it felt nice.
        <br>
        <br>
      im still documenting my time over break and im already down to like 20 minutes of recording time.<br><br>
        either way it's still fun to do. <br><br>
       my friends are doing their own things, and i havent talked to them as much.<br><br>
        it's fine though, at least we're all having fun in one way or another.<br><br>
        thanks again mr j for letting me borrow the camcorder :3 <br><br>
