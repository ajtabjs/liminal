    <p> well, small improvements are coming day by day.
        <br><br>
i just needed some time to think about it and plan it out.
        <br><br>
inventions are on my way to my house (and stickers too), so that'll be nice. <br><br>
       i have to get to it though and finish the rest of my work, <br><br>
        so there's that too.<br><br>
