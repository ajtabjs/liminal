    <p> went on a crazy hike today in what seemed like the middle of nowhere.
        <br><br>
it was epic.
        <br><br>
some people i talked to thought i was crazy for doing that,<br><br>
     but who cares? <br><br>
        i'm just enjoying myself and doing stupid things, <br><br>
        might as well have fun.<br><br>
        my business cards finally came to my house so that's fun. <br><br>
        it felt so great to get the thing that i spent time working on. <br><br>
        i'll just be chilling i guess.<br><br>
