    <p>things have gotten chaotic for me in the past day, again. <br> <br>
       people are yelling at me just because they don't understand what i'm going through. <br>
       <br> some of my friends won't even talk to me today.
       <br><br>
       that's how much time i need to take to myself.
       <br><br>
       with break coming up, it's confusing how i'm going to handle this.
       <br><br> i do know, that i won't stop until i finish my goals.
