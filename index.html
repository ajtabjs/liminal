<!--
a long night passed and i tried avoiding arguments.

while i didn't get into any, i still ended up not doing anything.

they put pressure on me and that just made the situation worse.

how the hell do you expect me to work calmly when you're trying to blame me for everything?

    <p> everytime i always end up doing something wrong,
        <br><br>
    or even not getting enough time.
        <br>
        <br>
       everyone says i make excuses, but they dont take the time to actually listen.<br><br>
        i can either end this week with a specatcular finish and only worry about spending time with friends, <br><br>
        or i can end it worrying my ass off about some assignments and try not to take it out on others.<br><br>
        either way, im sure my friends will understand somehow.<br><br>
        so why should i care? <br><br>
