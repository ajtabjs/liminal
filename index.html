<!-- the night before, i was thinking about the times i used to have, spending time with my family.
    now, i don't get to have much time with them anymore due to life, but its alright.
    i guess i'll just have to make the most out of it and to try and remember as much as I can.

    <p> sometimes it might not just be pieces of music or <br>
        wisdom here, sometimes it might be my memories or

        things that mean something to me.
