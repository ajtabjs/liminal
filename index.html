    <p> well i guess yesterday wasn't that bad
        <br><br>
    my brother's lucky and gets two days until his break.
        <br>
        <br>
       but eh, doesn't really matter much to me.<br><br>
        half the time, he's spent too much worrying about simple things that he can't control.<br><br>
        it takes a lot of power to try and be calm even in the tough times, so i don't know why everyone's so conflicted easily. <br><br>
        anyways, i don't know how things are going to go, i'll have to figure that out as i progress.<br><br>
