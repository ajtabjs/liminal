    <p>i'm too rushed right now so this entry will be short.
        <br><br>
        i've been wanting to start actually pursuing my goals and getting rid of my problems,
        <br>
        <br>
        but more and more keep coming up.<br><br>
        this one dude (in the picture) has helped me so much, it's literally the only good side of instagram for me.<br><br>
        i just hope i can prove people wrong.<br><br>
        i have friends that care for me so maybe they'll help, but who knows? <br><br>
