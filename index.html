    <p>you might be thinking, it's day thirty, a whole month since you made this!!
        <br><br>
        while that is great, it isn't a true month aniversary until a month after the first post on this.
        <br>
        <br>
        which is coming up in 3 days.<br><br>
        today's been alright, been eating most of thankgiving leftovers for the mostpart.<br><br>
        other than that, i've been fine, hiking and spending time with family.
        <br><br> yesterday though, the people i'd least expect to be thankful for me, were. <br><br> 
        and that was nice of them.
        <br><br> thanks, you know who you are.
