    <p> well, my friends left the group chat that i made with them.
        <br><br>
i don't know why, but life happens to everyone sometimes.
        <br><br>
maybe they need a break from me or something, i don't know.<br><br>
i'm going to try and relax today, i've been tired a lot lately. <br><br>
     either way, i have to change things once in a while. <br><br>
at least i can take a break today.<br><br>
        what ever happens, at least i spent some good time with them. <br><br>
        i guess we all need some time away from things. <br><br>
        thanks.<br><br>
